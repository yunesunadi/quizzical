# Quizzical

This is the final solo project of ["Learn React for free"](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) course on scrimba. It generates 5 random multiple choice questions from [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php), checks whether the chosen answer is correct or not, displays correct or wrong answers with different colors and counts the correct answers.
